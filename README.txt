README FILE
This is based off of a tutorial I found online at 
http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/247188-user-authentication-class/

I took the tutorial, made it into a full "app" and this is the end result.
As I find things to improve, I'll update this repository.

The main part of the system is the Auth.class.php which authenticates and checks
information. The AuthDB.class.php is the database layer and can be adjusted as 
necessary.

The files in the root directory show you various ways to use the system.
